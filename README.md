# Toggleable Optimizer
Used [AshOnDiscord/marlow1.17.1](https://github.com/AshOnDiscord/marlow1.17.1) as the base. 
Currently uses the fabric hotkey system combined with a client side message(allows easy log scanning aswell as easy since it's part of the fabric guide for hotkeys).
Maybe use modmenu in the future.

MC versions are grouped into major releases(1.14.x, 1.15.x etc rather than minor such as 1.14, 1.14.1 etc) as a single mod/codebase in a branch. The main branch is 1.17.x as it's the version of the base src(view above). 

**THIS IS FOR FABRIC ONLY. FORGE SUPPORT IS NOT PLANNED UNLESS EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE AND WORKING PERFECTLY**

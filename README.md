# Toggleable Optimizer
Used [AshOnDiscord/marlow1.17.1](https://github.com/AshOnDiscord/marlow1.17.1) as the base. 
Currently uses the fabric hotkey system combined with a client side message(allows easy log scanning aswell as easy since it's part of the fabric guide for hotkeys).
Maybe use modmenu in the future.
